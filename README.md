##Calis
 A simple lock & key puzzle platformer game made using Unity. Exploring the 2D physics engine, object collisions, transform modifications and simple gameplay.
Made in couple of days to push the limit and see if I really can make a finished game of whatever size in a limited amount of time
Done using Unity/ C#.
See Assets for code, Build for finished version for Windows
